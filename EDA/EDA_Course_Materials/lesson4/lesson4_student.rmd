### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}
setwd("~/GitHub/Udacity/EDA/EDA_Course_Materials/lesson4")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(alr3)

pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep = '\t')

dim(pf)

str(pf)

```

***

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:

***
Mostly people has lower friend counts, however younger people (below 30) tend to have higher friend counts There are intersting spikes around age 70 and over 100. Over 100 probably are fake users
 
### ggplot Syntax
Notes:

```{r ggplot Syntax}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y= friend_count), data =pf) + geom_point() +
  xlim(13,90)

summary(pf$age)

```

***

### Overplotting
Notes:

```{r Overplotting}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y= friend_count), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/20) +
  xlim(13,90)

# Add some noise

ggplot(aes(x = age, y= friend_count), data =pf) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20) +
  xlim(13,90)

```

#### What do you notice in the plot?
Response:
 Even though young users tend to have lots of friends, this plot says most of the young users have relatively less friends and alpha channel allows us to see the density of the friend count better when there is an over plotting.
***

### Coord_trans()
Notes:

```{r Coord_trans()}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y= friend_count), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/20) +
  xlim(13,90) +
  coord_trans(xtrans = 'identity', ytrans = 'sqrt')
```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y= friend_count), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/20, position = position_jitter(h=0)) +
  xlim(13,90) +
  coord_trans(xtrans = 'identity', ytrans = 'sqrt')

```

#### What do you notice?

***
Looks like older people tends to have a narrow band of friend counts, with sqrt we squeezed the y axis a bitso outliers came much closer to median values


### Alpha and Jitter
Notes:

```{r Alpha and Jitter}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friendships_initiated), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/15, position = position_jitter(h=0)) +
  xlim(13,90) + 
  coord_trans(ytrans = 'sqrt')
```

### Overplotting and Domain Knowledge
Notes:

***

### Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Conditional Means}
age_groups <- group_by(pf, age)

pf.fc_by_age<- summarise(age_groups, 
            friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
            friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
            n = n())

pf.fc_by_age <- arrange(pf.fc_by_age,age)

head(pf.fc_by_age)

pf %.%
  group_by(age) %.%
  summarise( friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count),
            friend_count_median = median(friend_count),
            n = n()) %.%
  arrange(age)

head(pf.fc_by_age,20)


```

Create your plot!

```{r Conditional Means Plot}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count_mean), data = pf.fc_by_age) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count_mean), data = pf.fc_by_age) + 
  geom_line()
```

***

### Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data
Notes:

```{r Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friendships_initiated), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05, 
             position = position_jitter(h=0),
             color = 'orange') +
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean) +
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile,
            prob = 0.1,
            linetype = 2,
            color ='blue') +
    geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile,
            prob = 0.9,
            linetype = 2,
            color ='blue') +
    geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = median,
            color ='blue') + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(13,70), ylim = c(0,1000))
```

#### What are some of your observations of the plot?
Response:

***
Response:median is less than mean since the friend count is a right skewed distribution. age 69 and age over 80 has lots of fake data. Young people has still more friend counts but most of them less than 1K

***

### Correlation
Notes:

```{r Correlation}
cor.test(x = pf$age, y =pf$friend_count,method = 'pearson')
```

Look up the documentation for the cor.test function.

What's the correlation between age and friend count? Round to three decimal places.
Response:

***

### Correlation on Subsets
Notes:

```{r Correlation on Subsets}
with(subset(pf, age <= 70), cor.test(age, friend_count, method = 'pearson'))
```

### Correlation Methods
Notes:

***

## Create Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = www_likes_received, y = likes_received), data =pf) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05, 
             position = position_jitter(h=0),
             color = 'red')  + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1000), ylim = c(0,2000))
```

***

### Strong Correlations
Notes:

```{r Strong Correlations}
ggplot(aes(x = www_likes_received, y = likes_received), data =pf) +
    geom_point() +
    xlim(0, quantile(pf$www_likes_received,0.95)) +
    ylim(0, quantile(pf$likes_received,0.95)) +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'red')

```

What's the correlation betwen the two variables? Include the top 5% of values for the variable in the calculation and round to 3 decimal places.

```{r Correlation Calcuation}
with(pf, cor.test(www_likes_received,likes_received), method = 'pearson')
```
